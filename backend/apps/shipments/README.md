# ðŸ“¦ Shipments Module (Customer App Backend Layer)

### Path
`backend/apps/shipments/`

---

## Overview
The **Shipments module** manages creation, tracking, and proof of delivery (POD) for customer deliveries under the LMDSP (B2C) ecosystem.  
It is the backbone of the delivery lifecycle, tightly integrated with:
- `CustomerProfile`
- `CustomerAddress`
- `Core` base models and middleware
- Future `Orders` and `Courier` modules

Supports hybrid shipment execution:
- Internal (LMDSP) tracking  
- External (3PL / DCSD) references  

---

## Key Components

### Models
- **Shipment:** Stores shipment lifecycle data.
- **ShipmentStatusHistory:** Logs each state transition and notes.

### Serializers
- Ensure validated, nested data for frontend (React/Next.js) consumption.

### Permissions
- `IsShipmentOwnerOrAdmin` â€” for sender control.
- `IsCourierAssignedOrReadOnly` â€” for courier task access.

### Views
- RESTful endpoints via DRF `ModelViewSet`.
- Custom actions:
  - `update_status` â€” update shipment state.
  - `upload_pod` â€” upload proof of delivery.

### URLs
`/api/shipments/` â€” root path for shipment endpoints.
